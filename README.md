# covidmap
[LIVE LINK HERE](https://damp-spire-98522.herokuapp.com/)
This is a basic covid map to show deaths from the Covid-19 virus. It automatically updates with the latest data.<br>
<br>
Ideally it would allow more configurability, but I'm just releasing as-is.<br>
<br>
It is in desparate need of refactoring but I decided to release as is.<br>
<br>
